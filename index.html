           <h3>Close your eyes and let some pop soul tell you a story</h3>
           <p>Trying to understand their project is labyrinthine although for them it is simple. The intention that the group has put into each of their compositions is totally unprecedented. In 2017 their first EP Superclean Vol. I arrived and a year later Vol. 2 arrived; After the release, his first studio album was expected but that did not happen, in its place came a handful of singles that only made expectations for his project grow in a very particular way. Today, after three years, the new thing from the Californian group arrives via Nice Life Recording. 
           Cinema is the name of this material that, according to The Marías, relates to its beginnings. For the title they decided to choose a simple word that would read as well in both Spanish and English - languages ​​that The Marías implements in their lyrics. An important point to emphasize since it has become part of their essence and could not be missing on this LP. Now, it is time for you to allow this movie to start. Close your eyes and enjoy it. A violin gently enters the rhythm of a guitar to give way to “Just a Feeling”. The track has no lyrics, but it doesn't need one. It really lives up to its name. That calm is all you need for your life. The scene changes and “Calling U Back” arrives with power to implement some delicate, and even sexy, pop. In order not to lose the line, “Hush” combines an intriguing dose of beats that offer you security and at the same time encourage you to take risks; and this is where you smile sarcastically and hide your secrets.
           In “All I Really Want Is You” you can perceive that passion and love with which it was made. Its melodious notes allow you to observe clear landscapes full of sentimentality. Already with the emotion on the surface, enjoying “Little by Little” is an incredible experience; The track arrives performed in Spanish and English and that alone makes the heart explode with such a welcoming interpretation. The beauty of the synths and drums instantly makes you smile and creates a stage full of sparkles. “Hable con ella” comes in immediately to weave the sequences into a totally instrumental track that sounds like a drama from a novel.
           The Marías emphasizes that everything around you can serve as inspiration to create, in fact this is one of the objectives of Cinema; contribute something for your creativity. In the case of “Heavy”, María says that she was inspired by a photograph that Josh showed her and from there she began to reflect her emotion through sounds; a track with a much more pop soul base that sounds playful, daring and that provokes an unusual stability thanks to a guitar solo. </p>
